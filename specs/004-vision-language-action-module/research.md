# Research: Docusaurus Structure for New Course Module

## Decision

A new course module, "Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)", will be added to the Docusaurus site. This will involve creating a new directory for the markdown files and updating the sidebar configuration.

## Rationale

The investigation of the existing `docs-site` directory revealed a clear and consistent structure for course modules.

1.  **Sidebar Configuration (`docs-site/sidebars.js`)**:
    -   The site uses a manually created sidebar named `courseSidebar`.
    -   Each module is defined as a `category` object with a `label` for the display name and an `items` array listing the document paths.
    -   This explicit configuration provides clear control over the order and structure of the course.

2.  **Directory Structure (`docs-site/docs`)**:
    -   Each module's markdown files are stored in a dedicated subdirectory (e.g., `module-1-ros2`).
    -   The paths in `sidebars.js` correspond to these subdirectories.

Adhering to this established pattern ensures consistency and leverages the existing Docusaurus setup without modification.

## Implementation Details

-   **New Directory**: `docs-site/docs/module-4-vla-course`
-   **New Markdown Files**:
    -   `docs-site/docs/module-4-vla-course/1-voice-to-action.md`
    -   `docs-site/docs/module-4-vla-course/2-llm-based-planning.md`
    -   `docs-site/docs/module-4-vla-course/3-autonomous-humanoid-capstone.md`
-   **Sidebar Update (`docs-site/sidebars.js`)**: A new category will be added to the `courseSidebar` array.

## Alternatives Considered

-   **Autogenerated Sidebar**: Docusaurus can automatically generate a sidebar from the directory structure. However, the project currently uses a manual sidebar (`courseSidebar`). Switching to an autogenerated one would be a larger change and is not necessary for adding a new module. The manual approach offers more control over the presentation, which is desirable for a course.
