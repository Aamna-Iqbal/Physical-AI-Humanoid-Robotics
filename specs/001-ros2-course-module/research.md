# Research for ROS 2 Course Module

## Decision: Use Docusaurus for the documentation site.

**Rationale**: The user explicitly requested to "Install Docusaurus, initialize the site, and configure sidebars". Docusaurus is a well-regarded open-source static site generator specializing in documentation, making it a perfect fit for this project. It is built with React and allows for content to be written in Markdown, which aligns with the project's constraints.

**Alternatives considered**:
*   **MkDocs**: A popular static site generator written in Python. While a good option, Docusaurus was explicitly requested.
*   **Hugo**: A very fast static site generator written in Go. It is more of a general-purpose static site generator.
*   **Jekyll**: A static site generator written in Ruby. It is the engine behind GitHub Pages.

No further research is required as the primary technology was mandated by the user.
