## Prompt

Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md

## Response snapshot

I have implemented the MVP of the ROS 2 course module website. The development server is running at http://localhost:3000/. Please validate the site.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created the Docusaurus site, configured it, and added the content for the first user story. The site is running and ready for validation.
- 🧪 Tests: Manual testing is required by the user.
- 📁 Files: Created and modified several files to set up the Docusaurus site and add content.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with the implementation of the next user stories.
- 🧠 Reflection: The initial attempt to run `create-docusaurus` failed due to an interactive prompt. I should have anticipated this and used the non-interactive flags from the beginning. The doc IDs generated by Docusaurus were also different from what I expected, which caused another issue. I should be more careful about how file-based routing generates IDs.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Interactive prompts in shell commands, unexpected ID generation from file names.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): For the next file-based routing, I will first check the generated IDs before using them in other places.
